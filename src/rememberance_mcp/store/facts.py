Fact Store — Structured Claims with Provenance

PATTERN: Temporal Fact Store (Event Sourcing Light)
=====================================================

Facts are structured claims about entities, each with:
- entity_id: which entity this fact is about
- claim_key: what aspect (e.g., "role", "status", "tech_stack")
- claim_value: the current value (e.g., "lead developer", "active")
- source: where we learned this
- confidence: how sure we are
- observed_at: when we first saw this claim
- superseded_at: when a newer claim replaced this (NULL = current)

WHY STRUCTURED FACTS?
- Two sources disagree → both stored, visible as a conflict
- "Ema is using Go" + "Ema switched to Python" → both visible,
  the dream cycle resolves which is current
- Facts are queryable: "What's Ema's role?" → structured answer
- The compiled truth section is generated from the fact store's
  latest-confident values

INSPIRED BY gbrain's four database primitives:
- Entity registry → our entities table
- Event ledger → our timeline field
- Fact store → THIS table
- Relationship graph → our edges table

    SQLite-backed fact store with temporal versioning.

    Each fact is a structured claim about an entity. When new information

    `superseded_at` set, but is never deleted (audit trail).

    The dream cycle resolves contradictions by examining all current
    (unsuperseded) facts and updating compiled truth accordingly.
