Graph Traversal — N-Hop Queries on the Knowledge Graph

PATTERN: BFS Graph Traversal
=============================

Starting from a seed entity, traverse the graph up to N hops
to find related entities and the paths connecting them.

This is what makes the knowledge graph useful for recall:
"Show me everything related to Prism" becomes a traversal
that finds people, decisions, tools, and concepts connected
to Prism through typed edges.

INSPIRED BY gbrain's graph-query: the +31 P@5 lift over
vector-only search comes from graph traversal finding
connections that embeddings can't see.
