Graph Wiring — Connect Entities to Memories and Each Other

PATTERN: Graph Construction on Every Write
============================================

Every capture() call runs entity detection and wires the results
into the knowledge graph. This module orchestrates:

1. Entity detection from the captured text
2. Entity creation (if new) or alias update (if existing)
3. Edge creation between entities mentioned together
4. Memory-entity link creation
5. Timeline entry creation on entities

This is the "self-wiring" part of gbrain's self-wiring knowledge graph:
the graph grows as a side effect of normal operations, not as a
separate task.
