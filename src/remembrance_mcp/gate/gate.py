Memory Gate — DilBERT 4-Class Classifier

PATTERN: Cascading Classifier (Early Exit)
============================================

A "cascading classifier" is a chain of models where each one is more
expensive than the last, and early exits prevent unnecessary computation.

This is the FIRST model in the cascade. It's designed to be:
  - Tiny (~250MB vs ~2.5GB for the extract model)
  - Fast (<100ms inference on CPU)
  - Conservative (better to save too much than miss important data)

HOW DISTILBERT WORKS:
  BERT = Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
  DisilBERT = "Distilled" BERT (compressed via knowledge distillation)

  Knowledge distillation is like a teacher-student process:
  1. Train a big "teacher" model (BERT, 110M params)
  2. Train a small "student" model to mimic the teacher's outputs
  3. Student learns the teacher's "soft probabilities" not just hard labels
  4. Result: 40% smaller, 60% faster, 97% of accuracy

  For our 4-class task, we fine-tuned DilBERT on labeled conversation data:
  - SKIP examples: "ok", "thanks", "hmm", "hello"
  - COLD examples: casual mentions, test data, small talk
  - ACTIVE examples: project status, task assignments, current work
  - PERSIST examples: decisions, architecture, people, rules

GATE DECISION LOGIC:
  The model outputs 4 probabilities (one per class).
  We pick the class with highest probability IF it crosses a threshold.
  This prevents the model from making confident wrong predictions.

  Edge case: what if two classes are close? We default to the MORE
  important class (better to over-save than under-save).
